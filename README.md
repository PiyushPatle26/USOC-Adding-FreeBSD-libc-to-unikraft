#  Project Documentation: Add FreeBSD libc as Unikraft External Library

##  Objective

The goal is to port the FreeBSD libc to Unikraft as an external library, similar to how `musl` or `newlib` is structured in Unikraft. The final deliverable should:

1. Integrate FreeBSD libc as an optional `lib-freebsd` component.
2. Support compilation and execution of simple applications (e.g., `c-hello`) against the FreeBSD libc.
3. Provide KConfig and Makefile.uk support to integrate cleanly with Unikraft's build system.
4. Serve as a foundation for more extensive libc usage within Unikraft ecosystem.
